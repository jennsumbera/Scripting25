        <p>Dipper Pines is a fictional character, he is 12 years old and later turns 13 in the series, his real name is
            Mason, but was given the nickname after his birthmark which is shaped like the Big Dipper. The world of
            gravity falls is set in Oregon; it is a small unknown town that wouldn't be found on a map. It is surrounded
            by forests and mountains. Most people would avoid it because of the creatures that are hidden inside, the
            ancient mysteries and the dimensional anomalies. </p>
